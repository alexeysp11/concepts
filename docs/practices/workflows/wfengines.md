# wfmicroengines

Advantages of using workflow engines include improved process automation, better visibility and control over business processes, and the ability to easily modify and optimize workflows. 

Disadvantages may include increased complexity, potential performance overhead, and the need for specialized expertise to implement and maintain the workflow engine. 

Workflow engines can be used in applications with a microservice architecture, but careful consideration should be given to how they interact with and coordinate between the individual microservices.
