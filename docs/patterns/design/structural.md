For example, if a server returns *JSON* but a client needs to get *XML*, we can use **Adapter pattern** in order to convert one interface to another. 

Effectively, the **Adapter pattern** is useful when you have existing code, be it third party, or in-house, but out of your control, or otherwise not changeable to quite meet the interface you need it to.

## Bridge 

The Bridge pattern is going to allow you to possibly have alternative implementations of an algorithm or system.
